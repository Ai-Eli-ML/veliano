## Recommendations

1. Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard
2. If using both next.config.js and next.config.mjs, consolidate to just one
3. Make sure output is set to 'standalone' in Next.js config
4. Verify build command is correctly set in Vercel

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Clear cache and redeploy
vercel deploy --force

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.production

# Check deployment logs
vercel logs
```

See [Vercel Deployment Checklist](.cursor/vercel-deployment-checklist.md) for complete verification steps.
