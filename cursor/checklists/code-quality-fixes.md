- Document any patterns or recurring issues for future reference
- Some files may require coordination with database schema or external dependencies
- Consider creating shared type definitions for common data structures
- Profile components have been implemented with proper TypeScript types and error handling
- Toast notification system has been implemented with full type safety
- All profile management components are now complete and type-safe
- Authentication testing infrastructure is set up with Vitest
- Avatar URL support added to profile components with proper fallbacks
- Next focus will be on fixing remaining TypeScript errors in components and pages
