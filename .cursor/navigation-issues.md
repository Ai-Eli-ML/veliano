# Navigation Issues Tracking

## Overview

This document tracks the 404 errors and navigation issues in the Veliano E-commerce application. The goal is to systematically identify, document, and fix all navigation-related issues as part of Phase 1 priorities.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Automated Testing**: Using the `scripts/check-navigation.js` script to identify potential broken links by:
   - Scanning all defined routes in the app directory
   - Finding all href links in components and pages
   - Cross-referencing to find missing routes

2. **Manual Testing**: Systematically checking all navigation paths by:
   - Following all navigation links in the header, footer, and sidebar menus
   - Testing all product links and category links
   - Validating all buttons that navigate to different pages
   - Testing all authentication flows

## Common Types of 404 Errors

1. **Missing Page Components**: Routes that exist in navigation but don't have corresponding page components
2. **Incorrect Path References**: Links that point to incorrect paths or outdated routes
3. **Dynamic Route Issues**: Problems with dynamic route parameters (e.g., `[slug]` or `[id]`)
4. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: Mismatches between path casing in links and actual routes
5. **Authentication Related**: Pages that require authentication but handle redirects incorrectly

## Issue Tracking

## Non-Issue Links (Excluded from Tracking)

The following "missing routes" were identified but don't need to be fixed as they are not actual navigation paths:

1. **Template Variables and Placeholders**:
   - `${i.src}`, `${languages:language}`, `${ruleUrl`, `%s`, `foo`

2. **JavaScript Actions**:
   - `javascript`, `javascript:void(0)`, `javascript:void(0);`, `javascriptFoo`

3. **Email Links**:
   - `mailto:aappleby@gmail.com`, `mailto:gary.court@gmail.com`, `mailto:jensyt@gmail.com`

4. **Data URIs and Resource Identifiers**:
   - Base64 encoded images and SVGs
   - `some unique resource identifier`, `url&quot;http://&quot;`, `a.css`

## Fixed Issues

| Route | Issue Type | Fix Applied | Fixed In | Notes |
|-------|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| | | | | Will be populated as issues are fixed |

## Testing Progress

- [x] Run initial automated check with `scripts/check-navigation.js`
- [x] Document all identified issues in this tracker
- [ ] Prioritize issues based on importance (main navigation > secondary pages)
- [ ] Fix highest priority issues first
- [ ] Retest after each fix to verify resolution
- [ ] Final comprehensive navigation test before completing Phase 1

## Prioritization Plan

1. **Highest Priority (Critical for User Flow)**:
   - Authentication pages: `/account/login`, `/account/register`, `/account/forgot-password`
   - Main product category pages: `/products/grillz`, `/products/jewelry`

2. **Medium Priority (Important for User Experience)**:
   - Account management: `/account/settings`, `/account/payment-methods` 
   - Product discovery: `/products/featured`, `/products/new`, `/products/sale`
   - About page: `/about`

3. **Lower Priority (Can be implemented later)**:
   - Admin-specific pages: `/admin/custom-orders/kits`, `/admin/help`
   - Specialized functionality: `/account/ambassador/apply`

## Related Issues

- Vercel deployment issues may affect how routes are resolved in production
- Authentication flows in development vs. production may behave differently
- Some routes may require additional middleware protection
