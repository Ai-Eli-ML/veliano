## Development Standards Update

### TypeScript and ESLint Priority Order:
1. Supabase integration files
2. Authentication and user-related files
3. Product and category management
4. Component and UI files
5. Utility functions

### Error Resolution Strategy:
1. Focus on errors blocking Supabase integration first
2. Address authentication-related type issues
3. Fix remaining type and lint errors incrementally

### Code Quality Metrics:
- Must have proper types for all Supabase interactions
- Authentication flows must be fully typed
- Product and category types must align with Supabase schema
- Components can use temporary type assertions where needed (to be refined later)
