# Deployment Monitoring Guide

## Initial Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Real-time Metrics to Watch
- Server response codes (watch for 5xx errors)
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API response times
- Database connection status
- Server CPU and memory usage
- Client-side JavaScript errors

### Monitoring Tools
- Vercel Analytics (if deployed on Vercel)
- Supabase Dashboard
- Browser DevTools
- Custom error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Server logs

### Critical Alerts to Set Up
- 5xx errors above threshold
- Authentication failure spike
- Database connection failures
- Payment processing errors
- Elevated API latency

## Post-Deployment Testing Checklist

### Immediate Tests (Within First Hour)
- [ ] Verify homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Test user registration flow
- [ ] Test user login flow
- [ ] Add product to cart
- [ ] Complete checkout process
- [ ] Search for products
- [ ] Test admin access

### First 24 Hours Tests
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify email notifications are being sent
- [ ] Check order processing end-to-end
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking
- [ ] Test social sharing functionality

## Rollback Procedure

### Criteria for Rollback
- Sustained 5xx error rate above 1%
- Critical user flows broken (authentication, checkout)
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Steps
1. Notify team of rollback decision
2. Deploy previous stable version
3. Verify database integrity
4. Run critical flow tests on rolled-back version
5. Notify users if appropriate
6. Document issue for future reference

## Performance Baseline

Record these metrics after deployment to establish a baseline:

| Metric | Expected Value | Actual Value | Status |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Homepage Load Time | < 2s | TBD | |
| Time to Interactive | < 3.5s | TBD | |
| Server Response Time | < 200ms | TBD | |
| Cart Update Time | < 500ms | TBD | |
| Checkout Completion | < 5s | TBD | |
| Search Response Time | < 1s | TBD | |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- Check Supabase auth settings
- Verify cookie handling in middleware
- Check for CORS issues with auth endpoints

### Payment Processing Issues
- Verify Stripe webhooks
- Check payment intent creation
- Validate product price synchronization

### Performance Issues
- Check for excessive JavaScript
- Verify image optimization
- Review API response times
- Check for N+1 queries

### Database Issues
- Monitor connection pool
- Check query performance
- Verify indexes are being used

## Week 1 Monitoring Schedule

### Day 1
- Hourly checks of critical metrics
- Immediate response to any errors
- Focus on core user flows

### Days 2-3
- 4-hour check intervals
- Monitor user feedback channels
- Begin addressing non-critical issues

### Days 4-7
- Daily metric reviews
- Weekly performance test
- Plan optimizations based on data
