# 404 Error Fixes

## Overview

This document tracks our progress in fixing missing routes and 404 errors in the Veliano Jewelry e-commerce application. This is a Phase 1 priority to ensure all navigation paths work properly.

## Missing Routes Identification

The navigation verification script has identified the following missing routes that need to be implemented:

### External Links (Referenced in UI)

- ✅ `/about` - Basic about page needed - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/account/settings` - Account settings page - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/account/ambassador/apply` - Ambassador application page - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/account/payment-methods` - Payment methods management - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/admin/help` - Admin help center - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/admin/settings` - Admin settings page - **COMPLETED**

### Standard Routes (Expected but Missing)

- ✅ `/404` - Custom 404 page - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/500` - Custom 500 error page - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `/auth/login` - Authentication login page (duplicate of `/account/login`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**
- ✅ `/auth/register` - Authentication registration page (duplicate of `/account/register`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**
- ✅ `/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request page (duplicate of `/account/forgot-password`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**
- ✅ `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset page (duplicate of `/account/reset-password`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**
- ✅ `/privacy` - Privacy policy page (duplicate of `/privacy-policy`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**
- ✅ `/terms` - Terms of service page (duplicate of `/terms-of-service`?) - **COMPLETED with redirect**

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Create skeleton pages for all missing routes to prevent 404 errors
2. ✅ Identify duplicate routes and set up redirects
3. ✅ Implement actual content for priority pages
4. ✅ Add proper routing in the navigation components

## Implementation Progress

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `/about` | ✅ Completed | Created basic about page with company information |
| `/account/settings` | ✅ Completed | Created account settings page with profile, password, notifications, and preferences tabs |
| `/account/ambassador/apply` | ✅ Completed | Created ambassador application form with benefits and requirements |
| `/account/payment-methods` | ✅ Completed | Created payment methods management page with saved cards and form to add new ones |
| `/admin/help` | ✅ Completed | Created admin help center with documentation and support resources |
| `/admin/settings` | ✅ Completed | Created admin settings page with store, shipping, tax, and user settings |
| `/404` | ✅ Completed | Created custom 404 page with navigation options |
| `/500` | ✅ Completed | Created custom 500 error page with navigation options |
| `/auth/login` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/account/login` |
| `/auth/register` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/account/register` |
| `/auth/forgot-password` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/account/forgot-password` |
| `/auth/reset-password` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/account/reset-password` |
| `/privacy` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/privacy-policy` |
| `/terms` | ✅ Completed | Created redirect to `/terms-of-service` |

## Additional Observations

The navigation verification script shows some inconsistencies in the authentication routes:
- There are both `/account/login` and `/auth/login` routes referenced
- There are both `/account/register` and `/auth/register` routes referenced
- There are both `/account/forgot-password` and `/auth/forgot-password` routes referenced

We've standardized on the `/account/...` pattern for consistency and implemented redirects from the `/auth/...` routes.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the remaining pages:
   - ✅ `/account/ambassador/apply`
   - ✅ `/account/payment-methods`
2. ✅ Run the navigation verification script again to confirm all 404 errors are fixed
3. Enhance the pages with proper content and functionality after all 404 errors are fixed

## Conclusion

All missing routes have been implemented, either as full pages or redirects to existing pages. This completes the Phase 1 priority task of fixing 404 errors in the application. The next step is to enhance these pages with proper functionality and integration with the backend once Supabase integration is implemented in Phase 2.
