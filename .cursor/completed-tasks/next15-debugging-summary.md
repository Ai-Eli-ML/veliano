# Next.js 15 Migration Debugging Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Promise Type Params in Client Components**
   - Fixed `params: Promise<{ ... }>` in client components to just `params: { ... }`
   - Removed unnecessary `await` for params in useEffect hooks
   - Applied to all dynamic route client components

2. **Metadata in Client Components**
   - Separated `generateMetadata` from client components
   - Created separate `metadata.ts` files where necessary
   - Fixed imports for metadata-related functionality

3. **Database Schema and Type Issues**
   - Fixed references to database tables in components
   - Ensured proper typing of database queries
   - Updated the Database type in supabase.ts to reflect current schema

## Remaining Issues

1. **Syntax Errors in Page Components**
   - Several page components have syntax errors after "use client" directive
   - Examples: `app/(auth)/account/forgot-password/page.tsx` and others
   - Pattern: TS1005: ';' expected / TS1109: Expression expected errors

2. **Database-Related Type Issues**
   - References to non-existent tables: 'carts', 'cart_items'
   - These need to be updated in `lib/supabase-helpers.ts` and other files

3. **Unused Types and Imports**
   - Many defined but unused types and interfaces across the codebase
   - Unused component imports especially in UI components

## Action Plan

1. **Fix Syntax Errors in Client Pages**
   - Syntax issue patterns suggest formatting problems between "use client" and other code
   - Need to ensure proper newlines after "use client" directive
   - Create script: `fix-use-client-syntax.sh`

2. **Clean up Database Types**
   - Update `Database` interface in `types/supabase.ts` to match actual schema
   - Remove or fix references to non-existent tables in helper files
   - Update all imports to use the correct table names

3. **Optimize Imports and Types**
   - Remove unused types to improve type checking performance
   - Clean up unnecessary imports for better code quality

4. **Fix Supabase Client Issues**
   - Update calls to match the latest Supabase API
   - Fix client creation calls with incorrect parameters

5. **Run Targeted Component Fixes**
   - For components with recurring issues like the product page
   - Apply specific fixes that address unique issues in each component

## Next Steps

1. Run the specific syntax fix script to address the most common errors
2. Address database type issues one category at a time
3. Focus on getting a successful build first, then clean up minor issues
4. Implement automated tests to prevent regression
