# Custom Email Verification Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of custom email verification using Supabase Auth hooks. This feature allows us to trigger our own custom email sending logic for verification emails when users sign up.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **Webhook Route for Supabase Auth Events**
   - Created in `app/api/auth/webhook/route.ts`
   - Handles incoming webhook events from Supabase
   - Processes new user signups and triggers custom verification emails
   - Implements security verification to ensure the webhook request is from Supabase

2. **Email Service Extension**
   - Added custom verification email functions to `lib/email.ts`
   - Implemented `sendVerificationEmail` function to handle verification emails
   - Created responsive HTML email template for verification emails
   - Maintained consistency with existing email design patterns

3. **Verification Confirmation Page**
   - Created in `app/auth/confirm/page.tsx`
   - Handles verification token validation
   - Provides user feedback on successful or failed verification
   - Guides users to the next step (login) after successful verification

## Key Features

- **Security**: Webhook requests are verified using a shared secret
- **Custom Templates**: Branded email templates consistent with the Veliano aesthetic
- **Responsive Design**: Email templates are responsive across devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all email operations
- **Type Safety**: All functions are properly typed according to project standards

## Required Environment Variables

- `SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Secret key for webhook verification
- `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`: SMTP server host
- `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`: SMTP server username
- `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`: SMTP server password
- `EMAIL_FROM`: Sender email address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Site URL for generating verification links

## Workflow

1. A new user signs up on the Veliano platform
2. Supabase triggers a webhook to our API endpoint
3. Our webhook handler verifies the request and extracts the user's email
4. The handler generates a verification token using Supabase's API
5. A custom verification email is sent to the user with a link to confirm their email
6. The user clicks the link and is directed to our confirmation page
7. The confirmation page verifies the token with Supabase
8. On successful verification, the user can proceed to login

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a full-featured email service provider
- Implement analytics tracking for email engagement
- Add support for multiple email templates (welcome, reset password, etc.)
- Implement i18n for email templates

## Technical Notes

- The implementation follows Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Email sending is handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the API response
- All functions are implemented according to functional programming principles
- Error tracking has been integrated for monitoring email delivery issues

## Completion Status

This task was completed on April 4, 2024, as part of the initial work for Phase 4 of the Veliano E-commerce project.
